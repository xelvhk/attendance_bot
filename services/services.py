# Legacy services file - most functionality moved to dedicated service classes
# This file is kept for backward compatibility and contains only
# functions that might still be referenced elsewhere

# NOTE: All new functionality should be added to the dedicated service classes:
# - AttendanceService for database operations
# - StatsService for statistics calculations
# - util.py for utility functions
